# ðŸ’» Workstation Setup

This repository contains my [Ansible] playbook to automatically provision new
workstations and servers. It is very opinionated and tailored to my own needs.

Feel free to use it as inspiration and fork it.

## Getting Started

The repository contains a [bootstrap script](bin/bootstrap) for macOS that can
be run on a fresh machine. It installs [Homebrew] and [Ansible], and then runs
the playbook with `ansible-pull`.

Open a terminal and run the following command. You will be prompted for your
password once so that [Homebrew] can be installed.

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdno/workstation/HEAD/bin/bootstrap)"
```
